# To-do-List-Application
This project is built using core C++ concepts and standard libraries, making it a solid choice for showcasing my skills. I’ve used structs to organize task details like description, priority, and completion status, which keeps the data handling simple and structured. The project is designed with OOP principles, where the ToDoList class handles all the logic like adding, displaying, and managing tasks, making the code modular and reusable. I’ve used vectors for dynamic task storage, so the list can grow or shrink as needed without worrying about memory limits. To make it more practical, I added file handling to save and load tasks, so users don’t lose their data when they exit the program. The menu-driven interface is user-friendly, with input validation to ensure smooth operation. Features like task priorities, completion status, and persistent storage make it stand out, as most students stop at basic console-based programs without these advanced touches. Overall, this project not only demonstrates my understanding of C++ but also shows that I can build something close to real-world applications.
